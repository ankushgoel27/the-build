    # Name of the remote branch to push the artifact to.
    # The remote_branch property is generally set dynamically, to 'artifact.prefix' plus
    # the current branch name. However, it may be overridden either in your project
    # properties or in a run-time flag (-Dartifact.git.remote_branch=foo) in order to
    # build to a static destination branch, or a branch name that matches other
    # constraints (like Pantheon's 11 character limit for multidev environment branch
    # names).
    #remote_branch:

    # Name of a branch to use as the base, if the artifact.remote_branch does not yet
    # exist on the artifact.git.remote repository.
    remote_base_branch: master

    # Name to use for the git remote on the artifact repository.
