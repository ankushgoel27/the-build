# Wrapper for our install command; at least this way it's somewhat discoverable.
#
# The install command boils down to:
#   vendor/bin/phing -f vendor/palantirnet/the-build/targets/install.xml
#
# * This script requires Composer 2.2.2 or greater, because of a series of script proxying
#   changes between 2.1.x and 2.2.2. This requirement is enforced in composer.json.
# * This script assumes the composer bin dir is at vendor/bin/

# Composer 2.2.2 through 2.2.6
